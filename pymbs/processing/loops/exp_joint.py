        Returns precalculated v(u), Bvu and b_prime, s.t.
        q = [u,v]', where
            u: independent coordinates
            v: dependent coordinates
        Starting from the Constraint Equation: Phi(q) = 0,
        One Obtains by Differentiation:
        (d(Phi)/du)*u_dot + (d(Phi)/dv)*v_dot = 0
        Ju*u_dot + Jv+v_dot = 0
        Thus, v_dot = -(inv(Jv)*Ju)*u_dot = Bvu*u_dot, with Jv = d(Phi)/dv and Ju = d(Phi)/du
        Differentiating once more, yields
        Ju*u_ddot + Jv*v_ddot + [Ju_dot, Jv_dot]*[u_dot,v_dot]' = 0
        Ju*u_ddot + Jv*v_ddot + J_dot*q_dot = 0
        Using this relations, one may obtain an expression for v_ddot
        v_ddot = -(inv(Jv)*Ju)*u_ddot - inv(Jv)*J_dot*q_dot
               = Bvu*u_ddot + b_prime, with b_prime = -inv(Jv)*J_dot*q_dot

        Finally one can transform the Equation of Motion
        M*q_ddot + h = f + W'*mu
        M*(J*u_ddot + b) + h = f + W'*mu    with J = [1, Bvu']' and b = [0,b_prime']'
        (J'*M*J)*u_ddot + J'*M*b + J'*h = J'*f, since J'*W' = 0
        M_star*u_ddot + h_star = f_star
        M_star = (J'*M*J)
        h_star = J'*M*b + J'*h
        f_star = J'*f
